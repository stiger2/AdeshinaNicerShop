# AdeshinaNicerShop
#This simple shopping app project has a main page, which contains a welcome message an a botton that takes users to the menu page
#The menu page is where users see items informations which include images, prices and descriptions. This is implemented using recyclerview.
#After users have added their desired items to cart  and also chosen their desired shipping method, the checkout and cancel button appear at the top of the page.
#A click on the cancel button takes users to the main page, a click on the checkout button takes users to the checkout page
#in the menuActivity, i implemented 2 menu icons, the first one is for the shopping cart where users can see what they have in the cart presently,
#and also how much it cost. The other meny icon is for the user to contact the website owner's directly, either for feedback or other concern.
#For the development process i used Pixel 3 XL API 29(Android 10, API29) as the emulator device
